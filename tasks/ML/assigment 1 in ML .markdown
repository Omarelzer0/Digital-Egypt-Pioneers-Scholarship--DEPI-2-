# Notebook Observations

Hey, let’s dive into these six Jupyter Notebooks that are all about building linear regression models with Scikit-learn in Python! They’re working with a health insurance dataset to predict costs, and each one brings something new to the table—like different spices in the same recipe. I’ll walk you through what each notebook does, how they prep the data, and how well they perform, with a special focus on what makes them stand out. Buckle up, it’s gonna be a fun ride!

## First Notebook

- **What’s the vibe?** This is the “keep it simple” starter. It builds a basic linear regression model to predict insurance costs.
- **Data:** A health insurance dataset with numeric stuff (like age, BMI) and categorical stuff (like smoker status, region).
- **How it preps the data:**
  - Checks **correlation** between numeric features to see how they vibe together.
  - Converts categorical features (like sex, smoker) to numbers using **LabelEncoder**—think of it as giving each category a number tag.
  - Splits the data into **80% training** and **20% testing** sets, with `random_state = 4` for consistency.
  - Uses **StandardScaler** to make all features play nice by standardizing them (faster math, better results!).
- **The model:** A no-frills **LinearRegression** model.
- **How’d it do?**
  - Tested on one sample from the test set, and the predicted value was **super close** to the actual one—error less than **0.0001**. Nailed it!
  - **Model Performance:**
    - **MSE** = 39,068,444 (big number, but it’s raw data).
    - **R²** = 0.697 (explains about 70% of the data’s variation).

## Second Notebook

- **What’s the vibe?** This one’s like, “Let’s be picky about our ingredients.” It builds on the first notebook but adds feature selection.
- **Data:** Same health insurance dataset as before.
- **How it preps the data:**
  - Uses **One-Hot Encoding** for the `region` feature, turning it into **4 new columns** (one for each region).
  - Applies **Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV)** to pick the best **6 out of 9 features**—like choosing the MVPs.
  - Plots different graphs because of the extra region columns.
- **The model:** Still **LinearRegression**, but now with a curated set of features.
- **How’d it do?**
  - **Model Performance:**
    - **MSE** = 39,379,620 (a tad higher than the first).
    - **R²** = 0.694 (just a smidge lower).

## Third Notebook

- **What’s the vibe?** This one’s all about giving the data a glow-up before modeling—like a makeover for better predictions.
- **Data:** Yup, same health insurance dataset.
- **How it preps the data:**
  - Plots **histograms** to check if the target column (insurance costs) is skewed (spoiler: it is).
  - Applies **Box-Cox transformation** to the target to make it more symmetric—less lopsided, more balanced.
  - Uses **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to shrink the features down to **7 principal components**, cutting the noise.
  - Data can be **reconstructed** from those PCA components if needed.
- **The model:** **LinearRegression** on this polished data.
- **How’d it do?**
  - **Model Performance:**
    - **MSE** = 0.46 (way lower because PCA changes the scale).
    - **R²** = 0.749 (nice, it’s explaining more of the data!).

## Fourth Notebook

- **What’s the vibe?** This one’s obsessed with making sure the model isn’t a one-hit wonder—it’s gotta work every time.
- **Data:** Same ol’ health insurance dataset.
- **How it preps the data:**
  - Uses **StandardScaler** and checks that feature **means** are ~0 and **variances** are ~1—everything’s in harmony.
  - Applies **K-Fold Cross-Validation** with **5 folds** to test the model in different ways, boosting **generalization**.
- **The model:** **LinearRegression** with a cross-validation twist.
- **How’d it do?**
  - **Model Performance:**
    - **Average R²** across folds = 0.7668 (super consistent!).
    - **MSE** = 0.468 (similar to the third).
    - **R²** = 0.740 (solid single-run score).

## Fifth Notebook (Mystery Edition)

- **What’s the vibe?** Okay, this one’s a bit of a ghost—we don’t have its name or full details, but let’s assume it’s trying to make the model more robust, maybe with **regularization** (like Ridge or Lasso) to prevent overfitting.
- **Data:** Gotta be the same health insurance dataset, right?
- **How it preps the data (best guess):**
  - Probably uses similar steps as the others: **LabelEncoder**, **OneHotEncoder**, and **StandardScaler** for consistency.
  - Might include **Box-Cox** and **PCA** (like the third and fourth) to keep the data tidy.
  - Could add **Ridge Regression** or **Lasso** to shrink less important features’ impact, making the model more stable.
- **The model:** Likely **Ridge** or **Lasso Regression** instead of plain **LinearRegression**.
- **How’d it do? (educated guess):**
  - Since it’s a step up from the fourth, let’s assume it gets a similar **R²** (~0.74–0.76) but with better stability on noisy data.
  - **MSE** would depend on whether it uses PCA (low like 0.46–0.48) or not (higher like 39M).
  - No hard numbers since we’re guessing, but it’s probably competitive with the third and fourth.

## Sixth Notebook

- **What’s the vibe?** This one’s the rockstar—it’s all about real-world action, making predictions in **real-time** and saving the model for later.
- **Data:** Same health insurance dataset
